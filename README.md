This is repository documenting my learning of backend development throughout 2025. While initially designed to organise and track my progress through Boot.dev's backend curriculum and Harvard's CS50P course, and incorporating practice from platforms like Exercism and Code Wars, the focus and content of which will likely change depending on what material I am learning. 

tldr; Just wanted a way to organise things more meaningfully.

## Structure

- Daily Logs: Daily progress and notes
- Notes: Course-specific content notes
- Practice: Exercism and Code Wars solutions
- Progress Tracking:
    - Concepts: Understanding of programming concepts
    - Milestones: Overall progress tracking
- Resources: Useful links and references
- Weekly Reviews: Weekly progress summaries

## Current Focus
